                            <p>Hello! My name is Sophia Yodice, and I am a junior journalism major at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, with a general business minor in the Robert H. Smith School of Business. Outside of the classroom, I am a staff writer for Stories Beneath the Shell, a member of the social media committee for Her Campus Maryland, and a ticket seller and usher at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center. As a journalist, I primarily focus on feature and multimedia storytelling, with an emphasis on people-driven narratives that highlight culture, community, and everyday experiences. </p>
                            <p>This ePortfolio serves as a curated collection of my work as a student journalist and storyteller. I created it to showcase my growth, versatility, and interests across different forms of journalism, including written features, multimedia projects, and social media content. Whether you are a professor, editor, potential employer, or simply someone curious about my work, this portfolio is designed to offer a clear and engaging overview of who I am as a journalist and where I hope to go professionally. </p>
                            <p>Navigation throughout the portfolio is simple and intuitive. At the top of the page, highlighted tabs organize my work by category, allowing readers to easily explore specific types of content. Each tab represents a different facet of my journalism, such as feature writing, multimedia storytelling, or campus-focused reporting. Within each section, you can click directly into individual stories through embedded links, which will take you to the full published pieces. </p>
                            <p>My involvement with student media organizations has strengthened my skills in pitching ideas, collaborating with editors, meeting deadlines, and adapting stories for digital audiences. Working in arts and campus spaces has also shaped my perspective as a journalist, reinforcing my interest in storytelling that centers creativity, accessibility, and human connection. I also enjoy exploring outside of my major and dabbling in marketing, advertising, and communications. </p>
                            <p>Looking ahead, I hope to continue developing my skills in feature writing and multimedia journalism, with an interest in lifestyle, culture, and audience-focused reporting. I am particularly drawn to stories that amplify underrepresented voices and explore the intersections of art, identity, and community. This portfolio represents where I am now in that journey, while also pointing toward the kind of work I aspire to produce in the future. </p>
                            <p>Finally, if you would like to learn more about me or stay connected, my social media profiles are linked on the final page of this portfolio. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I hope it gives you a clear sense of my passion for journalism and storytelling. </p>
