                            <p>This story is a reported feature that examines the role of visual arts at the University of Maryland and the institutional structures that support, challenge and shape creative work on campus. I wrote it as an enterprise piece focused on the broader arts ecosystem rather than a single event or exhibition. Reporting for this article involved interviewing a range of sources, including gallery staff, faculty members, administrators and students, to understand how creativity functions across different spaces such as the STAMP Gallery, Studio A, Arts for All and the Department of Art. The story was developed in the context of ongoing conversations about funding limitations, visibility and the place of the arts at a large, research-focused university, with the STAMP Gallery serving as an entry point into a wider network of creative initiatives.</p>
                            <p>This artifact demonstrates my ability to synthesize multiple perspectives into a cohesive, long-form narrative that balances human voices with institutional analysis. The piece shows my strengths in organizing complex material, using transitions and thematic framing to connect interviews across different programs while maintaining clarity for a general audience. It also reflects my reporting skills, including conducting interviews across levels of authority, contextualizing quotes and addressing challenges such as budget cuts and space constraints without losing focus on student experience. Overall, this story reveals my capacity for enterprise reporting, critical thinking and feature writing that connects individual stories to larger systems, an approach I aim to continue developing in culture and campus journalism.</p>

                    <div class="about">
                        <p>This story is a reported campus news feature covering the opening of Unboxing Innovation, an exhibition hosted by the University of Maryland Libraries’ Special Collections and University Archives. I wrote this piece in the context of an on-campus reception introducing the exhibit, which highlights archival research, preservation efforts and collaboration among faculty and staff. Reporting for the story included attending the event, interviewing university leaders, librarians, curators and students, and translating the goals of a long-term exhibition into clear, accessible language for a student audience. The article focuses on both the content of the exhibit—such as restored artifacts and cultural archives—and its broader purpose of redefining how archives function within a modern research university.</p>
                        <p>This artifact demonstrates my ability to report on institutional and academic topics while maintaining a strong narrative focus. The story shows my skill in synthesizing expert commentary and complex processes, such as archival research and preservation, into engaging, reader-friendly coverage. I used direct quotes and specific examples, like the Filipino American Community Archives and the restored Testudo, to humanize abstract concepts and emphasize cultural significance. This piece reveals my strength in event reporting, source coordination and explanatory writing, as well as my ability to connect historical material to present-day relevance—an essential skill for covering education, culture and public history.</p>

                    <div class="about">
                        <p>This story is a personality-driven feature profiling Robert Hawkins, known on campus as “Hype Hizzle,” and the impact his energy and creativity have on the University of Maryland community. I reported this piece by observing Hawkins in his work environment at Bagels n’ Grinds and interviewing him, his coworkers, students and alumni who interact with him regularly. The context for this story was the way campus culture is often shaped by individuals outside traditional leadership roles. Rather than focusing on food or business operations, I framed the article around Hawkins’ presence, tracing his journey from his early viral moments at the Bagel Place to his expanding social media influence and role as a source of positivity for students.</p>
                        <p>This artifact highlights my strength in feature writing that centers character, voice and atmosphere. I used descriptive detail, humor and direct quotes to capture Hawkins’ personality while balancing it with reporting from multiple perspectives to show his broader impact. The piece demonstrates my ability to build a narrative arc, moving from Hawkins’ origin story to his present-day influence and future aspirations. It also reflects my skill in gathering on-the-ground reactions and weaving short, meaningful quotes into the story to reinforce theme and tone. Overall, this story shows my ability to humanize campus culture through storytelling, creating engaging, feel-good journalism that still relies on solid reporting and structure.</p>
